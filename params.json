{"name":"DuQuad","tagline":"Quadratic Programming Optimization ","body":"The **DuQuad** optimization toolbox solves convex quadratic programs using _Dual First Order Optimization Algorithms_. The algorithms has predictable and fast convergence, low memory footprint, and uses only basic arithmetic and logical operations. **DuQuad** and is therefore suited to be utilized by real-time applications running on low-cost HW such as simple microcontrollers. \r\n\r\n**DuQuad** has an user friendly Matlab interface for maximum productivity, and the algorithms are implemented in efficient C-code. The SW is open source and can be downloaded from the git repository.\r\n\r\nThe **DuQuad** toolbox is created by _Sverre Kvamme_ as part of his Master's Thesis at NTNU, during the fall 2014. The implementation is done in close collaboration with _Ion Necoara_, Professor at Department of \r\nAutomatic Control and Systems Engineering, University Politehnica of Bucharest. The algorithms are described in detail in the following papers:\r\n\r\n* _Rate analysis of inexact dual first order methods: application to dual decomposition_, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2014\r\n* _Computational Complexity of Inexact Gradient Augmented Lagrangian Methods: Application to Constrained MPC_, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2014\r\n\r\nwhich can be downloaded from [here](http://acse.pub.ro/person/ion-necoara/).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDetailed documentation of the c-code is generated with Doxygen: [DuQuad_doc_ccode](http://sverrkva.github.io/duquad_doc_ccode/)  \r\n\r\nUser manual is found in the folder 'doc/' in the GitHub repository. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nSverre Kvamme - sverre.kvamme@gmail.com - NTNU","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
