{"name":"DuQuad","tagline":"Quadratic Programming Optimization ","body":"The **DuQuad** optimization toolbox solves convex quadratic programs using _Dual First Order Optimization Algorithms_. The algorithms has predictable and fast convergence, low memory footprint, and uses only basic arithmetic and logical operations. **DuQuad** and is therefore suited to be utilized by real-time applications running on low-cost HW such as simple microcontrollers. \r\n\r\n**DuQuad** has an user friendly Matlab interface for maximum productivity, and the algorithms are implemented in efficient C-code. The SW is open source and can be downloaded from the git repository.\r\n\r\nThe **DuQuad** toolbox is created by _Sverre Kvamme_ as part of his Master's Thesis at NTNU, during the fall 2014. The implementation is done in close collaboration with _Ion Necoara_, Professor at Department of \r\nAutomatic Control and Systems Engineering, University Politehnica of Bucharest. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe documentation is generated with Doxygen.  \r\nWeb: [DuQuad-Documentation-html](http://sverrkva.github.io/doc_qp-toolbox/)  \r\nPdf: (add link to dropbox or something)\r\n\r\n### User Manual\r\nDownload the an user's guide from:\r\n\r\n### Instruction video\r\nsee an video at: link to youtube instruction video\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nSverre Kvamme - sverre.kvamme@gmail.com - NTNU","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
