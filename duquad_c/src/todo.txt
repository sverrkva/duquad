TODOs

- make H and A as a simple vector (not dobbel pointer). Is it possible to make 2 vectors
so that row access will be fast in one, and column access will be fast in an other one?
- change boolean to bool
- use const
- clean the code






in FGM ():
- check z0 is feasible every time. can maybe do this only one time
- the computation H * z is done in both gradient and obj.
- z0 can be equal to z

in DGM ():
- check z0 is feasible every time in FGM(). can maybe do this only onze
- compute the same thing with lambda 2 times if using the z_last algorithm
- make some computations mroe times
- do optimize the code
- can be overflow when computing the norm
- What does really happen when [] is passed from matlab??
- Kan gjøre A*z færre ganger, se matlab!!

in math_functions():
- checking for overflow in vector_norm_2()


in DFGM()
- when calculating z_avg, should I use z or z_ds?????????????????????????
